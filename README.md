# Open_Table_Api [React Redux App] 

This is a full-stack app designed to consume the open-table API.

[Live Link](http://178.128.231.249)

**Functionalities:** Selecting A City To View Available Restaurants And Reserving a Table.

I am using **React, Redux**, axios and AntDesign (for React Design Framework) on the front end and **Express** on the backend.

To run this app:

* `git clone https://github.com/RohitoOo/opentable.git` - Clone this repo
* `cd into_directory` - Access Root Directory
* `npm install` - Install All Dependencies
* `npm start` - Launch Application Locally   

*Make Sure You Have nodeJs Installed Locally*
